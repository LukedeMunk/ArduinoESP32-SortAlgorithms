# ArduinoESP32-SortAlgorithms
This project is in production.

Sorting algorithms suitable for Arduino or ESP32 microcontrollers. The software is tested on the following boards:

* Arduino Nano

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The software is written, compiled and uploaded using the Arduino IDE (v1.8.13). You could use the online Arduino IDE or other software, but I recommend using the version you can download on [this page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### Installing

Clone the repository, copy the "SortAlgorithms" map in the Arduino libraries map (default path: "C:\Users\\[name]\Documents\Arduino\libraries"). For testing, you can navigate to the examples map and try some examples. 

## Hardware Required

* Arduino or ESP32 board
* USB to USB Mini cable
